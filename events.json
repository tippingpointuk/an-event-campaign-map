{"events": [{"description": "<p>On 29 October, we invite all local families and community members to come and lay a tribute in a memorial to all the people and places on the frontlines of the climate crisis. </p><p>This will be a simple memorial that celebrates the resilience and resistance of all those fighting against the injustice of climate change. It will be a chance to commemorate all the things, people and places we love that we stand to lose if world leaders don't get their act together and keep fossil fuels in the ground so we can limit global heating to 1.5C. &nbsp; </p><p>You are invited to come down at 6pm to lay your own creative tributes, personal items, flowers or a lantern (we suggest fairylights in a jar instead of candles in case of rain).  We will try to keep this memorial in place and gather to light again each evening until the end of COP26 when world leaders are meeting in Glasgow for last-ditch climate talks. &nbsp;</p><p>Check out defundclimatechaos.uk for a guide and materials for making climate memorial lanterns.
